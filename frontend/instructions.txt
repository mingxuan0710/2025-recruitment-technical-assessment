To work with the frontend code locally with the web server, you may have to run another web server.

To do this, run the following command once on your machine:

$ npm install --global http-server
Then whenever you want to start your server, run the following in the project's root folder:

$ npx http-server frontend -c 1 -p 8080

Any port number is fine.

This will start up a second HTTP server where if you navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or whatever URL/port it provides) it will run the index.html without any CORs issues.
